{"name":"Opensas","tagline":"An open source implementation of Shader Semantics and Annotations for GLSL","body":"### Welcome to OpenSAS\r\n\r\nThe intention of this project is to create a pre-processor for GLSL shader files (as supported by GLES and other GL flavours) that can parse shader annotations and semantics, storing the data in a convenient manner. The parser strips the non-standard tokens from the input files and presents pure GLSL code to the driver. The creation of shaders in many game engines is hindered by the need to hard code shader variable and attribute linkages in the host language. The use of SAS allows this process to be automated, making the development of shader code more efficient. \r\n  The advantage of this system over the existing SAS implementations is primarily down to the cross platform availability and popularity of OpenGL ES.  Nvidia's CG and Microsoft's HLSL are limited by their lack of availability on other platforms.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
